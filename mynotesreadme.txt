Configuration & Project Files:
.gitignore – Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
bun.lockb – Lock file related to Bun (an alternative JavaScript runtime).
eslint.config – JavaScript file for configuring ESLint (a linting tool for JavaScript/TypeScript).

Observations:
This appears to be a modern web project using Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.
The presence of Bun suggests that the project might be using it as a runtime instead of Node.js.
The ESLint and PostCSS configurations indicate that the project follows coding standards and styles.
